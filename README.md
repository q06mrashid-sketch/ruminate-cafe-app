# Ruminate Café App

## Configuration

Create an `.env` file based on `.env.example` and provide values for the variables below:


- `EXPO_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_FEED_URL` – endpoint that returns the latest Instagram post as JSON (`{ image, caption, url }`). Used on the Home screen to display and link to the most recent post.


Other Supabase-related variables are also required; see `.env.example` for defaults.
